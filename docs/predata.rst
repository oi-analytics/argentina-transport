Collected Data
==============
.. Important::
	- This section describes collected datasets that are used to create data for the Argentina Transport Risk Analysis (ATRA)
	- The datasets listed here are specfic to Argentina and are used as inputs to data in the Processed Data Assembly steps
	- To implement the ATRA pre-processing without any changes in existing codes, all data described here should be created and stored exactly as indicated below

Networks
--------
1. All pre-processed networks data are stored:
	- In sub-folders in the file path - ``/data/pre_processed_networks_data/``
	- As Shapefiles with of network nodes and edges
	- The names of files and folders are self-explanatory

2. All nodes should have the following attributes:
	- ``node_id`` - String Node ID
	- ``geometry`` - Point geometry of node with projection ESPG:4326
	- variable list of attributes depending upon sector

3. All edges should have the following attributes:
	- ``edge_id`` - String edge ID
	- ``g_id`` - Integer edge ID
	- ``from_node`` - String node ID that should be present in node_id column
	- ``to_node`` - String node ID that should be present in node_id column
	- ``geometry`` - LineString geometry of edge with projection ESPG:4326
	- variable list of attributes depending upon sector

.. Note::
	We assume that networks are provided as topologically correct connected graphs: each edge
	is a single LineString (may be straight line or more complex line), but must have exactly
	two endpoints, which are labelled as ``from_node`` and ``to_node`` (the values of these
	attributes must correspond to the ``node_id`` of a node).

	Wherever two edges meet, we assume that there is a shared node, matching each of the intersecting edge endpoints. For example, at a t-junction there will be three edges meeting
	at one node.


Cost attributes
---------------
1. Data to assign transport costs to network edges are stored:
	- In the file in path - ``/data/pre_processed_networks_data/mode_costs.xlsx``
	- As Excel sheets

2. All cost estimtates should have the following attributes:
	- ``time_cost_usd`` - Float values of rate of time
	- ``tariff_min_vnd`` - Float values minimum tariff rate in VND/ton-km (VND/ton for multi)
	- ``tariff_max_vnd`` - Float values maximum tariff rate in VND/ton-km (VND/ton for multi)
	- ``tariff_min_usd`` - Float values minimum tariff rate in USD/ton-km (USD/ton for multi)
	- ``tariff_max_usd`` - Float values maximum tariff rate in USD/ton-km (USD/ton for multi)
	- attributes to decide how the costs are allocated to network edges (if none then all edges have same criteria)

Road design attributes
----------------------
1. Data to assign characteristics to roads are stored:
	- In the file in path - ``/data/pre_processed_networks_data/road_properties.xlsx``
	- As Excel sheets
	- See ``/data/pre_processed_networks_data/road_properties.xlsx`` for data description


VITRANNS2 OD data
-----------------
1. VITRANSS2 province-level OD matrices are stored:
	- In the path - ``data/OD_data/``
	- As Excel sheets
	- ``goods`` sheet gives OD values by commodity
	- ``modes`` sheet gives OD values by mode

2. Aggregated goods-wise province-level national OD matrices have attributes:
	- ``o`` - Integer IDs of origin Provinces
	- ``d`` - Integer IDs of of destination Provinces
	- ``name o`` - String names of origin Provinces
	- ``name d`` - String names of destination Provinces
	- ``commodity_names`` - Float values of daily tonnages of commodities/industries between OD Provinces

3. Aggregated mode-wise province-level national OD matrices have attributes:
	- ``o`` - Integer IDs of origin Provinces
	- ``d`` - Integer IDs of of destination Provinces
	- ``name o`` - String names of origin Provinces
	- ``name d`` - String names of destination Provinces
	- ``mode_names`` - Float values of daily tonnages along modes between OD Provinces

IFPRI crop data
---------------
1. IFPRI crop datasets are stored:
	- In the path - ``data/Agriculture_crops/``
	- As GeoTiff files
	- Only files with names ``SPAM_P_crop name_ver3.tif`` are used
	- See Excel sheet in path ``data/Agriculture_crops//crop_data/crop_unit_costs.xlsx`` for costs of crops

2. All crop GeoTiff datasets should have attributes:
	- values greater than 0
	- raster grid geometry
	- projection systems: Default assumed = EPSG:4326

RiceAtlas data
--------------
1. RiceAtlas datasets are stored:
	- In the path - ``data/rice_atlas_argentina/``
	- As Shapefiles
	- Only the file ``rice_production.shp`` is used

2. The essential attributes in the dataset are listed below. See the data for all attributes:
	- ``sub_region`` - String names of Provinces in English
	- ``P_Jan``, ..., ``P_Dec`` - Column names with float tonnage produced in each month from January to December
	- ``geometry`` - Polygon geometries of Provinces

Points of interest data
-----------------------
1. Locations of populations, commune, district, province center committee points datasets are stored:
	- In the path - ``data/Points_of_interest/``
	- As Shapefiles

2. The essential attributes in all the dataset are listed below. See the data for all attributes:
	- ``geometry`` - Point geometry with projection ESPG:4326
